toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/ecology/iabiodiv_smartbiodiv_med_environ/iabiodiv_smartbiodiv_med_environ/0.1.0	"What it does
 This tool allows you to augment your dataset by adding some environmental variables grabbed from CMEMS, etopo, and woa. It is a galaxy tool built on the medenv python package available at https://github.com/jeremyfix/medenv. It will augment the dataset with environmental variables as provided by copernicus and etopo based on the informations coming from an ""observation file"". This version of the tool gets environmental data from etopo for the bathymetry and otherwise copernicus mediterranean products. We expect the dataset you provide to contain the coordinates of the observation: latitude, longitude, depth, and time. The time is expected in ISO 8601: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ The 
cmems_username
 and 
cmems_password
 are required only if you want to add variables provided by CMEMS. These must be defined in ""User -> Preferences -> Manage Information"" The CMEMS data are collected from the following products : - med-cmcc: https://resources.marine.copernicus.eu/product-detail/MEDSEA_MULTIYEAR_PHY_006_004/INFORMATION - med-ogs: https://resources.marine.copernicus.eu/product-detail/MEDSEA_MULTIYEAR_BGC_006_008/INFORMATION The bathymetry is obtained with the ETOPO at : - https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/global/relief/ETOPO1/data/bedrock/grid_registered/netcdf/ETOPO1_Bed_g_gmt4.grd.gz We request data around the point with a given tolerance and average the collected values. The medenv package does not force that averaging and could return a raster. A later update of the Galaxy tool could take this into account. The features you can request are the following, some indexed by depth : - ""bathymetry"", (etopo) - ""temperature"", - ""salinity"", - ""chlorophyl-a"", - ""nitrate"", - ""phosphate"", - ""ammonium"", - ""phytoplankton-carbon-biomass"", - ""oxygen"", - ""net-primary-production"", - ""ph"", - ""alkalinity"", - ""dissolved-inorganic-carbon"", - ""northward-water-velocity"", - ""eastward-water-velocity"". and others not indexed by depth : - ""mixed-layer-thickness"", - ""sea-surface-temperature"", - ""sea-surface-salinity"", - ""sea-surface-above-geoid"", - ""surface-partial-pressure-co2"", - ""surface-co2-flux"". ** Copernicus credentials ** To request Copernicus, you need to have an account on the https://resources.marine.copernicus.eu platform.

toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/ecology/argo_getdata/argo_getdata/0.1.15+galaxy0	"========================================================== Argo data access to global ocean in situ observing system. ========================================================== In order to ease Argo data analysis for the vast majority of standard users, we implemented in argopy different levels of verbosity and data processing to hide or simply remove variables only meaningful to experts. Let argopy manage data wrangling, and focus on your scientific analysis. If you don’t know in which category you would place yourself, try to answer the following questions: - [] what is a WMO number ? - [] what is the difference between Delayed and Real Time data mode ? - [] what is an adjusted parameter ? - [] what a QC flag of 3 means ? If you don’t answer to more than 1 question: you probably will feel more comfortable with the standard or research user modes. By default, all argopy data fetchers are set to work with a standard user mode, the other possible modes are research and expert. 
What it does
 This tool based on argopy is able to fetch (i.e. access, download, format) Argo data into netcdf files. 
Input description
 - This tool provides 3 user modes: - 🏄 expert mode return all the Argo data, without any postprocessing, - 🏊 standard mode simplifies the dataset, remove most of its jargon and return a priori good data, - 🚣 research mode simplifies the dataset to its heart, preserving only data of the highest quality for research studies, including studies sensitive to small pressure and salinity bias (e.g. calculations of global ocean heat content or mixed layer depth). - The tool provides 3 different data selection methods: - 🗺 For a space/time domain (to select data for a rectangular space/time domain) - 🤖 For one or more floats (if you know the Argo float unique identifier number called a WMO number you can use this mode) - ⚓ For one or more profiles (specify the float WMO platform number and the profile cycle number(s) to retrieve profiles) - The tool can retrieve data from : - ⭐ the Ifremer 
erddap
 server (Default). The erddap server database is updated daily and doesn’t require you to download anymore data than what you need. You can select this data source with the keyword erddap and methods described below. The Ifremer erddap dataset is based on mono-profile files of the GDAC. Since this is the most efficient method to fetcher Argo data, it’s the default data source in argopy. - With this tool you can thus get access to the following Argo data: - the 
phy
 dataset, for physical parameters. This dataset provides data from floats that measure temperature, salinity, pressure, without limitation in depth. It is available from all Available data sources. Since this is the most common Argo data subset it’s selected with the phy keyword by default in argopy. - the 
bgc
 dataset, for biogeochemical parameters.This dataset provides data from floats that measure temperature, salinity, pressure and oxygen, pH, nitrate, chlorophyll, backscatter, irradiance, without limitation in depth. You can select this dataset with the keyword bgc and methods described below. 
Output
 You can retrieve the Argo data in one netcdf file.

toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/sra_tools/sam_dump/3.1.1+galaxy1	"What it does?
 This tool extracts data (in BAM_ format) from the Short Read Archive (SRA) at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). It is based on the sam-dump_ utility of the SRA Toolkit and returns a collection of NGS data containing one file for each accession number provided. 
How to use it?
 There are three ways in which you can download data: 1. Plain text input of accession number(s) 2. Providing a list of accessions from file 3. Extracting data from an already uploaded SRA dataset Below we discuss each in detail. ------ 
Plain text input of accession number(s)
 When you type an accession number (e.g., 
SRR1582967
) into 
Accession
 box and click 
Execute
 the tool will fetch the data for you. You can also provide a list of multiple accession numbers (e.g. 
SRR3141592, SRR271828, SRR112358
). ----- 
Providing a list of accessions from file
 A more realistic scenario is when you want to upload a number of datasets at once. To do this you need a list of accession, where there is only one accession per line (see below for information on how to generate such a file). Once you have this file: 1. Upload it into your history using Galaxy's upload tool 2. Once the list of accessions is uploaded choose 
List of SRA accessions, one per line
 from 
select input type
 dropdown 3. Choose uploaded file within the 
sra accession list
 field 4. Click 
Execute
 ----- 
Extract data from an already uploaded SRA dataset
 If an SRA dataset is already present in the history, the sequencing data can be extracted in a human-readable data format (fastq, sam, bam) by setting 
select input type
 drop-down to 
SRA archive in current history
. ----- 
How to generate accession lists
 1. Go to 
SRA Run Selector
 by clicking this link_ 2. Find the study you are interested in by typing a search term within the 
Search
 box. This can be a word (e.g., 
mitochondria
) or an accession you have gotten from a paper (e.g., 
SRR1582967
). 3. Once you click on the study of interest you will see the number of datasets in this study within the 
Related SRA data
 box 4. Click on the Runs number 5. On the page that would open you will see 
Accession List
 button 6. Clicking of this button will produce a file that you will need to upload into Galaxy and use as the input to this tool. ----- .. _sam-dump: https://github.com/ncbi/sra-tools .. _BAM: https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf .. _collection: https://galaxyproject.org/tutorials/collections/ .. _link: https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/index.html?view=run_browser&display=reads For credits, information, support and bug reports, please refer ato https://github.com/galaxyproject/tools-iuc."

toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/query_impc/query_impc/0.9.0	"What it does
 With this tool, it is possible to submit various types of queries to the IMPC database. Select the desired query from the drop down menu. As input both MGI IDs or gene symbols are allowed (even mixed). If you want to input more than one ID, separate them with a comma without spaces (eg: MGI:104636,MGI:104637). If a mixed input is retrieved, the order after the mapping will not be maintained. Note that if the mapping between the two types of IDs doesn't retrieves a result, that ID will not be included in the query input, resulting in an error if all of the IDs are not mapped. The output will be a table containing the data. For the phenotypes, is possible to give as input both MP term IDs or HP terms IDs since they will be mapped to MP terms (also here the order of the input will not be maintained). For both genes and phenotypes mapping, check the ""View details"" section of the job to check if some of them were not mapped (typo errors/ID not present in the database). For queries requiring an IMPReSS pipeline ID, here_ is possible to find a complete list with details about each pipeline. For query 7 no inputs are required and you can choose if including genes without identified phenotypes or not. In query number 9, a top level phenotype category is required as input. On IMPC, phenotypes are divided into 20 categories to summarize wich systems are mainly influenced by the phenotype. In the database they are 24, since some of them are splitted into different groups: +-----------------------------------------+---------------------------------------+ | Top level phenotype category name | top level phenotype category ID | +=========================================+=======================================+ | Immune system phenotype | MP:0005387 | +-----------------------------------------+---------------------------------------+ | Integument phenotype | MP:0010771 | +-----------------------------------------+---------------------------------------+ | Adipose tissue phenotype | MP:0005375 | +-----------------------------------------+---------------------------------------+ | Hearing/vestibular/ear phenotype | MP:0005377 | +-----------------------------------------+---------------------------------------+ | Hematopoietic system phenotype | MP:0005397 | +-----------------------------------------+---------------------------------------+ | Craniofacial phenotype | MP:0005382 | +-----------------------------------------+---------------------------------------+ | Cardiovascular system phenotype | MP:0005385 | +-----------------------------------------+---------------------------------------+ | Renal/urinary system phenotype | MP:0005367 | +-----------------------------------------+---------------------------------------+ | Homeostasis/metabolism phenotype | MP:0005376 | +-----------------------------------------+---------------------------------------+ | Pigmentation phenotype | MP:0001186 | +-----------------------------------------+---------------------------------------+ | Limbs/digits/tail phenotype | MP:0005371 | +-----------------------------------------+---------------------------------------+ | Nervous system phenotype | MP:0003631 | +-----------------------------------------+---------------------------------------+ | Vision/eye phenotype | MP:0005391 | +-----------------------------------------+---------------------------------------+ | Liver/biliary system phenotype | MP:0005370 | +-----------------------------------------+---------------------------------------+ | Respiratory system phenotype | MP:0005388 | +-----------------------------------------+---------------------------------------+ | Behavior/neurological phenotype | MP:0005386 | +-----------------------------------------+---------------------------------------+ | Skeleton phenotype | MP:0005390 | +-----------------------------------------+---------------------------------------+ | Mortality/aging | MP:0010768 | +-----------------------------------------+---------------------------------------+ | Reproductive system phenotype | MP:0005389 | +-----------------------------------------+---------------------------------------+ | Endocrine/exocrine gland phenotype | MP:0005379 | +-----------------------------------------+---------------------------------------+ | Growth/size/body region phenotype | MP:0005378 | +-----------------------------------------+---------------------------------------+ | Embryo phenotype | MP:0005380 | +-----------------------------------------+---------------------------------------+ | Muscle phenotype | MP:0005369 | +-----------------------------------------+---------------------------------------+ | Digestive/alimentary phenotype | MP:0005381 | +-----------------------------------------+---------------------------------------+ | | Moreover, the when the output of a query is a list of genes, the user can choose if the output will be MGI IDs or gene symbols.

upload1	"Auto-detect
 The system will attempt to detect Axt, Fasta, Fastqsolexa, Gff, Gff3, Html, Lav, Maf, Tabular, Wiggle, Bed and Interval (Bed with headers) formats. If your file is not detected properly as one of the known formats, it most likely means that it has some format problems (e.g., different number of columns on different rows). You can still coerce the system to set your data to the format you think it should be. You can also upload compressed files, which will automatically be decompressed. ----- 
Ab1
 A binary sequence file in 'ab1' format with a '.ab1' file extension. You must manually select this 'File Format' when uploading the file. ----- 
Axt
 blastz pairwise alignment format. Each alignment block in an axt file contains three lines: a summary line and 2 sequence lines. Blocks are separated from one another by blank lines. The summary line contains chromosomal position and size information about the alignment. It consists of 9 required fields. ----- 
Bam
 A binary file compressed in the BGZF format with a '.bam' file extension. ----- 
Bed
 * Tab delimited format (tabular) * Does not require header line * Contains 3 required fields: - chrom - The name of the chromosome (e.g. chr3, chrY, chr2_random) or contig (e.g. ctgY1). - chromStart - The starting position of the feature in the chromosome or contig. The first base in a chromosome is numbered 0. - chromEnd - The ending position of the feature in the chromosome or contig. The chromEnd base is not included in the display of the feature. For example, the first 100 bases of a chromosome are defined as chromStart=0, chromEnd=100, and span the bases numbered 0-99. * May contain 9 additional optional BED fields: - name - Defines the name of the BED line. This label is displayed to the left of the BED line in the Genome Browser window when the track is open to full display mode or directly to the left of the item in pack mode. - score - A score between 0 and 1000. If the track line useScore attribute is set to 1 for this annotation data set, the score value will determine the level of gray in which this feature is displayed (higher numbers = darker gray). - strand - Defines the strand - either '+' or '-'. - thickStart - The starting position at which the feature is drawn thickly (for example, the start codon in gene displays). - thickEnd - The ending position at which the feature is drawn thickly (for example, the stop codon in gene displays). - itemRgb - An RGB value of the form R,G,B (e.g. 255,0,0). If the track line itemRgb attribute is set to ""On"", this RBG value will determine the display color of the data contained in this BED line. NOTE: It is recommended that a simple color scheme (eight colors or less) be used with this attribute to avoid overwhelming the color resources of the Genome Browser and your Internet browser. - blockCount - The number of blocks (exons) in the BED line. - blockSizes - A comma-separated list of the block sizes. The number of items in this list should correspond to blockCount. - blockStarts - A comma-separated list of block starts. All of the blockStart positions should be calculated relative to chromStart. The number of items in this list should correspond to blockCount. * Example:: chr22 1000 5000 cloneA 960 + 1000 5000 0 2 567,488, 0,3512 chr22 2000 6000 cloneB 900 - 2000 6000 0 2 433,399, 0,3601 ----- 
Fasta
 A sequence in FASTA format consists of a single-line description, followed by lines of sequence data. The first character of the description line is a greater-than ("">"") symbol in the first column. All lines should be shorter than 80 characters:: >sequence1 atgcgtttgcgtgc gtcggtttcgttgc >sequence2 tttcgtgcgtatag tggcgcggtga -----

Gff
 GFF lines have nine required fields that must be tab-separated. ----- 
Gff3
 The GFF3 format addresses the most common extensions to GFF, while preserving backward compatibility with previous formats. ----- 
Interval (Genomic Intervals)
 - Tab delimited format (tabular) - File must start with definition line in the following format (columns may be in any order).:: #CHROM START END STRAND - CHROM - The name of the chromosome (e.g. chr3, chrY, chr2_random) or contig (e.g. ctgY1). - START - The starting position of the feature in the chromosome or contig. The first base in a chromosome is numbered 0. - END - The ending position of the feature in the chromosome or contig. The chromEnd base is not included in the display of the feature. For example, the first 100 bases of a chromosome are defined as chromStart=0, chromEnd=100, and span the bases numbered 0-99. - STRAND - Defines the strand - either '+' or '-'. - Example:: #CHROM START END STRAND NAME COMMENT chr1 10 100 + exon myExon chrX 1000 10050 - gene myGene ----- 
Lav
 Lav is the primary output format for BLASTZ. The first line of a .lav file begins with #:lav.. ----- 
MAF
 TBA and multiz multiple alignment format. The first line of a .maf file begins with ##maf. This word is followed by white-space-separated ""variable=value"" pairs. There should be no white space surrounding the ""="". -----

You can provide either accession IDs in text format or upload a file containing accession IDs (one per line). The tool also allows you to group downloaded data by experiment or sample and can optionally retrieve only metadata without downloading the FASTQ files. Input Types ----------- You can select from two types of inputs: 1. 
ENA Accession IDs (Text Input)
: - Provide a list of ENA accession IDs (e.g., Study, Sample, Experiment, or Run accessions) separated by whitespace. 2. 
Accession IDs File
: - Provide a file containing a list of ENA accession IDs, one per line. Parameters ---------- - 
Group by Experiment
: This option groups the downloaded runs by the experiment accession, which can be useful if you need to process data related to a specific experiment. - 
Group by Sample
: This option groups the downloaded runs by the sample accession. - 
Only Download Metadata
: Select this option if you only want to retrieve metadata without downloading the actual FASTQ files. This is useful if you need information about the runs but do not need the raw sequence data. Outputs ------- The tool generates three types of outputs: 1. 
Metadata Files
: This collection contains metadata files for each accession, in 
.tsv
 format, which provide details about the corresponding run. 2. 
Single-End Data
: If the input FASTQ files contain single-end reads, those files will be placed into a separate collection. In 
.fastq.gz
 format. 3. 
Paired-End Data
: If the input FASTQ files contain paired-end reads, those files will be grouped into pairs (forward and reverse). The paired files will also be placed in a separate collection and will be in 
.fastq.gz

Sequencing instruments
 
Comparisons between HiSeq instruments
 HiSeq 3000/4000 provides some improvements with respect the previous model HiSeq 2500: - HiSeq 3000/4000 genere up to 1.5 Tb and 5 Tb reads per run. - HiSeq 3000/4000 use patterned flow cell technology originally developed for HiSeq X platforms. - HiSeq 3000/4000 run 3 times faster and yield 65% more reads per lane. - HiSeq 3000/4000 patterned flow cells contain billions of nanowells at fixed, known positions on the flow cell. The structured organization enables clustering at higher densities compared to non-pattern HiSeq designs. However, the HiSeq 3000/4000 also have some also some limitations with respect to HiSeq 2500: - HiSeq 3000/4000 are not recommended for low complexity sequencing. Applications such as non-unique amplicons, 16S, are currently not recommended. - Libraries with low complexity within the first 25 bases of a read are not expected to produce high quality data. - Library size restrictions. Libraries that are too long can result in polyclonal clusters that span more than 1 well, these will not pass filter. Smaller libraries will preferentially amplify with Illumina's new kinetic exclusion amplification so tight library distributions ranging from 300-500 bp are recommended. - Very low tolerance for adapter dimers. Even as little as 1% adapter dimer can take up ~6% of sequencing reads, 10% contamination will take up 84% of reads. Illumina recommends you keep adapter contamination below 0.5% of your entire library. - Higher duplication rates as compared to HiSeq 2500. - Low quality read 2 (entire HiSeq 3000 install base is affected). HiSeq 3000/4000 support DNA-seq, RNA-seq , ChIP-Seq, mate-pair, small RNA and exome library preparation. Any library preparation where there is enough sequence diversity is currently supported. Amplicon, 16S and applications with low sequencing diversity are currently not supported on the HiSeq 3000 / 4000. HiSeq 2500 is considered the most reliable model according to different sources. 
What type of read quality is expected from the HiSeq 3000/4000 ?
 - 2 x 50bp ≥85% bases > Q30 - 2 x 75bp ≥80% bases > Q30 - 2 x 150bp ≥75% of bases >Q30 
What is the difference between MiSeq and HiSeq?
 HiSeq and MiSeq platforms are among the most widely used platform to study microbial communities. But the two platforms differ in the length and amount of reads. MiSeq can run 600 cycles to produce 200 million 300 bp reads, on the other hand, HiSeq 2500 can run 500 cycles to produce 120 million 250 bp. 
What are the differences between HiSeq and NovaSeq?
 The Illumina NovaSeq provides a massive upgrade in sequencing throughput compared to the HiSeq 4000. There are more stringent library requirements and requires a larger sample size. Due to the vast amount of data produced by the NovaSeq and the known issue of index swapping, unique dual-indexed libraries are required. 
What are the characteristics of HiSeq X instruments?
 - HiSeq X is recommended for whole genome sequencing only (including whole bisulfite sequencing). This means that it is not adequate for RNA-seq, exome, ChIP-seq or small RNA-seq applications. - Plant and animal samples can be sequenced on the HiSeq X. - Expect coverate is over 30x or approximately 375 million reads per lane by loading one sample per lane. - Hiseq X Ten generates utilize 2x150 base pair read configurations and has slightly better GC coverage than the HiSeq 2500. 
What are the differences between MiSeq and Nextseq?
 The NextSeq Series of systems delivers the power of high-throughput sequencing with the simplicity of a desktop sequencer. NextSeq instruments represent an improvement when compared with Miseq, despite generating sorter reads (150bp, compared to MiSeq 250bp). NextSeq is recommended in the following applications & methods: - Exome & large panel sequencing (enrichment-based) - Single-cell profiling (scRNA-Seq, scDNA-Seq, oligo tagging assays) - Transcriptome sequencing (total RNA-Seq, mRNA-Seq, gene expression profiling) - Methylation sequencing - Metagenomic profiling (shotgun metagenomics, metatranscriptomics) - Cell-free sequencing & liquid biopsy analysis Regarding the maximum number of reads per ran, MiSeq can generate 25 million, vs 400 million generated by the Nextseq 550 instrument. MiSeq recommended for sequencing samples of low diversity. 
What are the differences between HiSeq and NextSeq?
 The main technical difference between HiSeq and NextSeq will be the number of dyes each machines use. HiSeq uses traditional color coding with four different dyes, while NextSeq uses two dyes. This does not give any practical differences in terms of the data quality, but the trend in illumina sequencers are more into the direction of reducing the number of dyes. 
What is the difference between Nextseq and NovaSeq?
 The NovaSeq 6000 system offers deep and broad coverage and is recommended for large whole-genome sequencing (human, plant, animal) projects. It generates 250 bp reads, with 20 billion maximum reads per run. NovaSeq 6000 instruments have not application based restrictions. 
Illumina maximum read-length summary
 - MiSeq: between 300 and 600 bp - NextSeq: 300 bp - HiSeq 2500: between 250 and 500 bp (depending of the sofware) - HiSeq 4000: 150 bp - HiSeq X: 150 bp 
Nanopore models - single-molecule ultra-long-read sequencing
 Nanopore sequencing provides the longest read lengths, from 500 bp to the current record of 2.3 Mb, with 10-30-kb genomic libraries being common. Even after error correction, sequencing error rates of corrected nanopore reads (1.5-9%) are still higher than those of corrected PacBio reads (<1%). 
PacBio SMRT instruments - single-molecule long-read low-error rate sequencing
 PacBio Sequel II CLR sequencing represents a major advancement in sequencing throughput over previous PacBio platforms with the production of more sequencing data and longer reads versus RS II and the Sequel I. The PacBio HiFi sequencing method yields highly accurate long-read sequencing datasets with read lengths averaging 10-25 kb and accuracies greater than 99.5%."
