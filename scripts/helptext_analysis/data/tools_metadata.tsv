toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/bgruening/split_file_to_collection/split_file_to_collection/0.5.2	Split file	to dataset collection	collection_operations	Collection Operations	"Split file into a dataset collection
 This tool splits a data set consisting of records into multiple data sets within a collection. A record can be for instance simply a line, a FASTA sequence (header + sequence), a FASTQ sequence (headers + sequence + qualities), etc. The important property is that the records either have a specific length (e.g. 4 lines for FASTQ) or that the beginning/end of a new record can be specified by a regular expression, e.g. "".
"" for lines or "">.
"" for FASTA. The tool has presets for text, tabular data sets (which are split after each line), FASTA (new records start with "">.*""), FASTQ (records consist of 4 lines), SDF (records start with ""^BEGIN IONS"") and MGF (records end with ""^$$$$""). For other data types the text delimiting records or the number of lines making up a record can be specified manually using the generic splitter. If the generic splitter is used, an option is also available to split records either before or after the separator. If a preset filetype is used, this is selected automatically (after for SDF, before for all others). If splitting by line (or by some other item, like a FASTA entry or an MGF record), the splitting can be either done alternatingly, in original record order, or at random. If t records are to be distributed to n new data sets, then the i-th record goes to data set * floor(i / t * n) (for batch), * i % n (for alternating), or * a random data set For instance, t=5 records are distributed as follows on n=2 data sets = === === ==== i bat alt rand = === === ==== 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 2 0 0 1 3 1 1 0 4 1 0 0 = === === ==== If the five records are distributed on n=3 data sets: = === === ==== i bat alt rand = === === ==== 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 2 1 2 2 3 1 0 0 4 2 1 1 = === === ==== Note that there are no guarantees when splitting at random that every result file will be non-empty, so downstream tools should be able to gracefully handle empty files. If a tabular file is used as input, you may choose to split by line or by column. If split by column, a new file is created for each unique value in the column. In addition, (Python) regular expressions may be used to transform the value in the column to a new value. Caution should be used with this feature, as it could transform all values to the same value, or other unexpected behavior. The default regular expression uses each value in the column without modifying it. Two modes are available for the tool. For the main mode, the number of output files is selected. In this case, records are shared out between this number of files. Alternatively, 'chunking mode' can be selected, which puts a fixed number of records (the 'chunk size') into each output file."

 This tool allows you to augment your dataset by adding some environmental variables grabbed from CMEMS, etopo, and woa. It is a galaxy tool built on the medenv python package available at https://github.com/jeremyfix/medenv. It will augment the dataset with environmental variables as provided by copernicus and etopo based on the informations coming from an ""observation file"". This version of the tool gets environmental data from etopo for the bathymetry and otherwise copernicus mediterranean products. We expect the dataset you provide to contain the coordinates of the observation: latitude, longitude, depth, and time. The time is expected in ISO 8601: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ The 
cmems_username
 and 
cmems_password
 are required only if you want to add variables provided by CMEMS. These must be defined in ""User -> Preferences -> Manage Information"" The CMEMS data are collected from the following products : - med-cmcc: https://resources.marine.copernicus.eu/product-detail/MEDSEA_MULTIYEAR_PHY_006_004/INFORMATION - med-ogs: https://resources.marine.copernicus.eu/product-detail/MEDSEA_MULTIYEAR_BGC_006_008/INFORMATION The bathymetry is obtained with the ETOPO at : - https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/global/relief/ETOPO1/data/bedrock/grid_registered/netcdf/ETOPO1_Bed_g_gmt4.grd.gz We request data around the point with a given tolerance and average the collected values. The medenv package does not force that averaging and could return a raster. A later update of the Galaxy tool could take this into account. The features you can request are the following, some indexed by depth : - ""bathymetry"", (etopo) - ""temperature"", - ""salinity"", - ""chlorophyl-a"", - ""nitrate"", - ""phosphate"", - ""ammonium"", - ""phytoplankton-carbon-biomass"", - ""oxygen"", - ""net-primary-production"", - ""ph"", - ""alkalinity"", - ""dissolved-inorganic-carbon"", - ""northward-water-velocity"", - ""eastward-water-velocity"". and others not indexed by depth : - ""mixed-layer-thickness"", - ""sea-surface-temperature"", - ""sea-surface-salinity"", - ""sea-surface-above-geoid"", - ""surface-partial-pressure-co2"", - ""surface-co2-flux"".

toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/ecology/argo_getdata/argo_getdata/0.1.15+galaxy0	Argo data access	for global ocean in situ observing system	get_data	Get Data	"========================================================== Argo data access to global ocean in situ observing system. ========================================================== In order to ease Argo data analysis for the vast majority of standard users, we implemented in argopy different levels of verbosity and data processing to hide or simply remove variables only meaningful to experts. Let argopy manage data wrangling, and focus on your scientific analysis. If you don’t know in which category you would place yourself, try to answer the following questions: - [] what is a WMO number ? - [] what is the difference between Delayed and Real Time data mode ? - [] what is an adjusted parameter ? - [] what a QC flag of 3 means ? If you don’t answer to more than 1 question: you probably will feel more comfortable with the standard or research user modes. By default, all argopy data fetchers are set to work with a standard user mode, the other possible modes are research and expert. 
What it does
 This tool based on argopy is able to fetch (i.e. access, download, format) Argo data into netcdf files. 
Input description
 - This tool provides 3 user modes: - 🏄 expert mode return all the Argo data, without any postprocessing, - 🏊 standard mode simplifies the dataset, remove most of its jargon and return a priori good data, - 🚣 research mode simplifies the dataset to its heart, preserving only data of the highest quality for research studies, including studies sensitive to small pressure and salinity bias (e.g. calculations of global ocean heat content or mixed layer depth). - The tool provides 3 different data selection methods: - 🗺 For a space/time domain (to select data for a rectangular space/time domain) - 🤖 For one or more floats (if you know the Argo float unique identifier number called a WMO number you can use this mode) - ⚓ For one or more profiles (specify the float WMO platform number and the profile cycle number(s) to retrieve profiles) - The tool can retrieve data from : - ⭐ the Ifremer 
erddap
 server (Default). The erddap server database is updated daily and doesn’t require you to download anymore data than what you need. You can select this data source with the keyword erddap and methods described below. The Ifremer erddap dataset is based on mono-profile files of the GDAC. Since this is the most efficient method to fetcher Argo data, it’s the default data source in argopy. - With this tool you can thus get access to the following Argo data: - the 
phy
 dataset, for physical parameters. This dataset provides data from floats that measure temperature, salinity, pressure, without limitation in depth. It is available from all Available data sources. Since this is the most common Argo data subset it’s selected with the phy keyword by default in argopy. - the 
bgc
 dataset, for biogeochemical parameters.This dataset provides data from floats that measure temperature, salinity, pressure and oxygen, pH, nitrate, chlorophyll, backscatter, irradiance, without limitation in depth. You can select this dataset with the keyword bgc and methods described below. 
Output
 You can retrieve the Argo data in one netcdf file.

 This tool extracts data (in BAM_ format) from the Short Read Archive (SRA) at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). It is based on the sam-dump_ utility of the SRA Toolkit and returns a collection of NGS data containing one file for each accession number provided. 
How to use it?
 There are three ways in which you can download data: 1. Plain text input of accession number(s) 2. Providing a list of accessions from file 3. Extracting data from an already uploaded SRA dataset Below we discuss each in detail. ------ 
Plain text input of accession number(s)
 When you type an accession number (e.g., 
SRR1582967
) into 
Accession
 box and click 
Execute
 the tool will fetch the data for you. You can also provide a list of multiple accession numbers (e.g. 
SRR3141592, SRR271828, SRR112358
). ----- 
Providing a list of accessions from file
 A more realistic scenario is when you want to upload a number of datasets at once. To do this you need a list of accession, where there is only one accession per line (see below for information on how to generate such a file). Once you have this file: 1. Upload it into your history using Galaxy's upload tool 2. Once the list of accessions is uploaded choose 
List of SRA accessions, one per line

 With this tool, it is possible to submit various types of queries to the IMPC database. Select the desired query from the drop down menu. As input both MGI IDs or gene symbols are allowed (even mixed). If you want to input more than one ID, separate them with a comma without spaces (eg: MGI:104636,MGI:104637). If a mixed input is retrieved, the order after the mapping will not be maintained. Note that if the mapping between the two types of IDs doesn't retrieves a result, that ID will not be included in the query input, resulting in an error if all of the IDs are not mapped. The output will be a table containing the data. For the phenotypes, is possible to give as input both MP term IDs or HP terms IDs since they will be mapped to MP terms (also here the order of the input will not be maintained). For both genes and phenotypes mapping, check the ""View details"" section of the job to check if some of them were not mapped (typo errors/ID not present in the database). For queries requiring an IMPReSS pipeline ID, here_ is possible to find a complete list with details about each pipeline.

 Given a file containing a list of NCBI accession numbers or a direct entry of accession numbers in the tool text input box, this tool will download the corresponding sequence records via the NCBI API. 
Limitations
 - For protein sequence downloads, only fasta format is supported - To avoid rate-limits imposed by the NCBI API, records are downloaded sequentially with a delay between requests. This may make it impractical to use this tool to download many (>100) records. 
Output
 A collection of sequence records in the desired format."

 The system will attempt to detect Axt, Fasta, Fastqsolexa, Gff, Gff3, Html, Lav, Maf, Tabular, Wiggle, Bed and Interval (Bed with headers) formats. If your file is not detected properly as one of the known formats, it most likely means that it has some format problems (e.g., different number of columns on different rows). You can still coerce the system to set your data to the format you think it should be. You can also upload compressed files, which will automatically be decompressed. ----- 
Ab1
 A binary sequence file in 'ab1' format with a '.ab1' file extension. You must manually select this 'File Format' when uploading the file. ----- 
Axt
 blastz pairwise alignment format. Each alignment block in an axt file contains three lines: a summary line and 2 sequence lines. Blocks are separated from one another by blank lines. The summary line contains chromosomal position and size information about the alignment. It consists of 9 required fields. ----- 
Bam
 A binary file compressed in the BGZF format with a '.bam' file extension. ----- 
Bed
 * Tab delimited format (tabular) * Does not require header line * Contains 3 required fields: - chrom - The name of the chromosome (e.g. chr3, chrY, chr2_random) or contig (e.g. ctgY1). - chromStart - The starting position of the feature in the chromosome or contig. The first base in a chromosome is numbered 0. - chromEnd - The ending position of the feature in the chromosome or contig. The chromEnd base is not included in the display of the feature. For example, the first 100 bases of a chromosome are defined as chromStart=0, chromEnd=100, and span the bases numbered 0-99. * May contain 9 additional optional BED fields: - name - Defines the name of the BED line. This label is displayed to the left of the BED line in the Genome Browser window when the track is open to full display mode or directly to the left of the item in pack mode. - score - A score between 0 and 1000. If the track line useScore attribute is set to 1 for this annotation data set, the score value will determine the level of gray in which this feature is displayed (higher numbers = darker gray). - strand - Defines the strand - either '+' or '-'. - thickStart - The starting position at which the feature is drawn thickly (for example, the start codon in gene displays). - thickEnd - The ending position at which the feature is drawn thickly (for example, the stop codon in gene displays). - itemRgb - An RGB value of the form R,G,B (e.g. 255,0,0). If the track line itemRgb attribute is set to ""On"", this RBG value will determine the display color of the data contained in this BED line. NOTE: It is recommended that a simple color scheme (eight colors or less) be used with this attribute to avoid overwhelming the color resources of the Genome Browser and your Internet browser. - blockCount - The number of blocks (exons) in the BED line. - blockSizes - A comma-separated list of the block sizes. The number of items in this list should correspond to blockCount. - blockStarts - A comma-separated list of block starts. All of the blockStart positions should be calculated relative to chromStart.

Sequencing instruments
 
Comparisons between HiSeq instruments
 HiSeq 3000/4000 provides some improvements with respect the previous model HiSeq 2500: - HiSeq 3000/4000 genere up to 1.5 Tb and 5 Tb reads per run. - HiSeq 3000/4000 use patterned flow cell technology originally developed for HiSeq X platforms. - HiSeq 3000/4000 run 3 times faster and yield 65% more reads per lane. - HiSeq 3000/4000 patterned flow cells contain billions of nanowells at fixed, known positions on the flow cell. The structured organization enables clustering at higher densities compared to non-pattern HiSeq designs. However, the HiSeq 3000/4000 also have some also some limitations with respect to HiSeq 2500: - HiSeq 3000/4000 are not recommended for low complexity sequencing. Applications such as non-unique amplicons, 16S, are currently not recommended. - Libraries with low complexity within the first 25 bases of a read are not expected to produce high quality data. - Library size restrictions. Libraries that are too long can result in polyclonal clusters that span more than 1 well, these will not pass filter. Smaller libraries will preferentially amplify with Illumina's new kinetic exclusion amplification so tight library distributions ranging from 300-500 bp are recommended. - Very low tolerance for adapter dimers. Even as little as 1% adapter dimer can take up ~6% of sequencing reads, 10% contamination will take up 84% of reads. Illumina recommends you keep adapter contamination below 0.5% of your entire library. - Higher duplication rates as compared to HiSeq 2500. - Low quality read 2 (entire HiSeq 3000 install base is affected). HiSeq 3000/4000 support DNA-seq, RNA-seq , ChIP-Seq, mate-pair, small RNA and exome library preparation. Any library preparation where there is enough sequence diversity is currently supported. Amplicon, 16S and applications with low sequencing diversity are currently not supported on the HiSeq 3000 / 4000. HiSeq 2500 is considered the most reliable model according to different sources. 
What type of read quality is expected from the HiSeq 3000/4000 ?
 - 2 x 50bp ≥85% bases > Q30 - 2 x 75bp ≥80% bases > Q30 - 2 x 150bp ≥75% of bases >Q30 
What is the difference between MiSeq and HiSeq?
 HiSeq and MiSeq platforms are among the most widely used platform to study microbial communities. But the two platforms differ in the length and amount of reads. MiSeq can run 600 cycles to produce 200 million 300 bp reads, on the other hand, HiSeq 2500 can run 500 cycles to produce 120 million 250 bp. 
What are the differences between HiSeq and NovaSeq?
 The Illumina NovaSeq provides a massive upgrade in sequencing throughput compared to the HiSeq 4000. There are more stringent library requirements and requires a larger sample size. Due to the vast amount of data produced by the NovaSeq and the known issue of index swapping, unique dual-indexed libraries are required. 
What are the characteristics of HiSeq X instruments?
 - HiSeq X is recommended for whole genome sequencing only (including whole bisulfite sequencing). This means that it is not adequate for RNA-seq, exome, ChIP-seq or small RNA-seq applications. - Plant and animal samples can be sequenced on the HiSeq X. - Expect coverate is over 30x or approximately 375 million reads per lane by loading one sample per lane. - Hiseq X Ten generates utilize 2x150 base pair read configurations and has slightly better GC coverage than the HiSeq 2500. 
What are the differences between MiSeq and Nextseq?
 The NextSeq Series of systems delivers the power of high-throughput sequencing with the simplicity of a desktop sequencer. NextSeq instruments represent an improvement when compared with Miseq, despite generating sorter reads (150bp, compared to MiSeq 250bp). NextSeq is recommended in the following applications & methods: - Exome & large panel sequencing (enrichment-based) - Single-cell profiling (scRNA-Seq, scDNA-Seq, oligo tagging assays) - Transcriptome sequencing (total RNA-Seq, mRNA-Seq, gene expression profiling) - Methylation sequencing - Metagenomic profiling (shotgun metagenomics, metatranscriptomics) - Cell-free sequencing & liquid biopsy analysis Regarding the maximum number of reads per ran, MiSeq can generate 25 million, vs 400 million generated by the Nextseq 550 instrument. MiSeq recommended for sequencing samples of low diversity. 
What are the differences between HiSeq and NextSeq?
 The main technical difference between HiSeq and NextSeq will be the number of dyes each machines use. HiSeq uses traditional color coding with four different dyes, while NextSeq uses two dyes. This does not give any practical differences in terms of the data quality, but the trend in illumina sequencers are more into the direction of reducing the number of dyes. 
What is the difference between Nextseq and NovaSeq?
 The NovaSeq 6000 system offers deep and broad coverage and is recommended for large whole-genome sequencing (human, plant, animal) projects. It generates 250 bp reads, with 20 billion maximum reads per run. NovaSeq 6000 instruments have not application based restrictions. 
Illumina maximum read-length summary
 - MiSeq: between 300 and 600 bp - NextSeq: 300 bp - HiSeq 2500: between 250 and 500 bp (depending of the sofware) - HiSeq 4000: 150 bp - HiSeq X: 150 bp 
Nanopore models - single-molecule ultra-long-read sequencing
 Nanopore sequencing provides the longest read lengths, from 500 bp to the current record of 2.3 Mb, with 10-30-kb genomic libraries being common. Even after error correction, sequencing error rates of corrected nanopore reads (1.5-9%) are still higher than those of corrected PacBio reads (<1%). 
PacBio SMRT instruments - single-molecule long-read low-error rate sequencing
 PacBio Sequel II CLR sequencing represents a major advancement in sequencing throughput over previous PacBio platforms with the production of more sequencing data and longer reads versus RS II and the Sequel I. The PacBio HiFi sequencing method yields highly accurate long-read sequencing datasets with read lengths averaging 10-25 kb and accuracies greater than 99.5%."

Syntax
 - 
Maximum distance
 is greatest distance in base pairs allowed between intervals that will be considered ""clustered"". 
Negative
 values for distance are allowed, and are useful for clustering intervals that overlap. - 
Minimum intervals per cluster
 allow a threshold to be set on the minimum number of intervals to be considered a cluster. Any area with less than this minimum will not be included in the output. - 
Merge clusters into single intervals
 outputs intervals that span the entire cluster. - 
Find cluster intervals; preserve comments and order
 filters out non-cluster intervals while maintaining the original ordering and comments in the file. - 
Find cluster intervals; output grouped by clusters
 filters out non-cluster intervals, but outputs the cluster intervals so that they are grouped together. Comments and original ordering in the file are lost. -----

TIP:
 If your data is not TAB delimited, use 
Text Manipulation->Convert
 ----- 
What it does
 This tool computes an expression on every row of a dataset and appends or inserts the result as a new column (field). Several expressions can be specified and will be applied sequentially to each row. 
Expression rules
 - Columns are referenced with 
c
 and a 
number
. For example, 
c1
 refers to the first column of a tab-delimited file - The following built-in Python functions are available for use in expressions:: abs | all | any | ascii | bin | bool | chr | complex | divmod | float | format | hex | int | len | list map | max | min | oct | ord | pow | range | reversed | round | set | sorted | str | sum | type acos | acosh | asin | asinh | atan | atan2 | atanh | cbrt | ceil | comb | copysign | cos | cosh | degrees dist | erf | erfc | exp | exp2 | expm1 | fabs | factorial | floor | fmod | frexp | fsum | gamma | gcd hypot | inf | isclose | isfinite | isinf | isnan | isqrt | ldexp | lgamma | log | log10 | log1p | log2 modf | nextafter | perm | pow | prod | remainder | sin | sqrt | tan | tanh | tau | trunc | ulp - In addition the numpy function 
format_float_positional
 is available to control the formatting of floating point numbers. - Expressions can be chained, and the tool will keep track of newly added columns while working through the chain. This means you can reference a column that was created as the result of a previous expression in later ones. ----- 
Simple examples
 If this is your input:: chr1 151077881 151077918 2 200 - chr1 151081985 151082078 3 500 + computing ""c4 * c5"" will produce:: chr1 151077881 151077918 2 200 - 400 chr1 151081985 151082078 3 500 + 1500 You can also use this tool to evaluate expressions. For example, computing ""c3 >= c2"" for the input above will result in the following:: chr1 151077881 151077918 2 200 - True chr1 151081985 151082078 3 500 + True Similarly, computing ""type(c2) == type(c3) will return:: chr1 151077881 151077918 2 200 - True chr1 151081985 151082078 3 500 + True ----- 
Error handling
 The tool will always fail on syntax errors in and other unrecoverable parsing errors with any of your expressions. For other problems, however, it offers control over how they should be handled: 1. The default for ""Autodetect column types"" is ""Yes"", which means the tool will evaluate each column value as the type that Galaxy assumes for the column. This default behavior will allow you to write simpler expressions. The arithmetic expression ""c4 * c5"" from the first simple example, for instance, works only because Galaxy realizes that c4 and c5 are integer columns. Occasionally, this autodetection can cause issues. A common such situation are missing values in columns that Galaxy thinks are of numeric type. If you're getting errors like ""Failed to convert some of the columns in line #X ..."", a solution might be to turn off column type autodetection. The price you will have to pay for doing so is that now you will have to handle type conversions yourself. In the first example you would now have to use the epression: ""int(c4) * int(c5)"". 2. By default, if any expression references columns that are not existing before that expression gets computed, the tool will fail, but you can uncheck the ""Fail on references to non-existent columns"" option. If you do so, the result will depend on your choice for ""If an expression cannot be computed for a row"" (see 3.) 3. The default for rows, for which an expression fails to compute is, again, to fail the tool run, but you can also choose to: - skip the row on output This is a simple way to only keep lines conforming to an expected standard. It is also easy to mask problems with your expressions with this option so take a look at the results and try to understand what gets skipped and for what reasons (the stdout of the tool will contain information about both). - keep the row unchanged This can be a good solution if your input contains special separator lines that don't follow the general tabular format of other lines and you would like to keep those lines - produce an empty column value for the row This will use the empty string as a substitute for non-computable items. Different from the ""keep the row unchanged option"" the problematic line will have a column added or changed. This option is a good choice for inputs in which all rows have the same tabular layout where you want to make sure that the same is true for the output, i.e. that all output lines still have the same number of columns. - fill in a replacement value This option is very similar to the previous one, but lets you control the replacement value. 
Example
 In the following input:: chr1 151077881 151077918 2 200 - chr1 151081985 151082078 3 500 + chr1 151090031 151090938 4 700 the last line does not have a strand column. This violates the bed file format specification, which says that unknown strand is to be encoded as

toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/gff3_rebase/gff3.rebase/1.2	Rebase GFF3 features	against parent features	text_manipulation	Text Manipulation	"What it does
 Often the genomic data processing/analysis process requires a workflow like the following: - select some features from a genome - export the sequences associated with those regions - analyse those exports with some tool like Blast For display, especially in software like JBrowse, it is convenient to know where in the original genome the analysis results would fall. E.g. if a transmembrane domain is detected at bases 10-20 of an analysed protein, where should this be displayed relative to the parent genome? This tool helps fill that gap, by rebasing some analysis results against the parent features which were originally analysed. 
Example Inputs
 For a ""child"" set of annotations like:: #gff-version 3 cds42 blastp match_part 1 50 1e-40 . . ID=m00001;Notes=RNAse A Protein And a parent set of annotations like:: #gff-version 3 PhageBob maker cds 300 600 . + . ID=cds42 One could imagine that during the analysis process, the user had exported the parent annotation into some sequence:: >cds42 M...... and then analysed those results, producing the ""child"" annotation file. This tool will then localize the results properly against the parent:: #gff-version 3 PhageBob blastp match_part 300 449 1e-40 + . ID=m00001;Notes=RNAse A Protein which will allow you to display the results in the correct location in visualizations. 
Options
 There are two optional flags which can be passed. The Interpro flag selectively ignores features which shouldn't be included in the output (i.e. 
polypeptide
), and a couple of qualifiers that aren't useful (
status
, 
Target
) The ""Map Protein..."" flag says that you translated the sequences during the genomic export process, analysing protein sequences. This indicates to the software that the bases should be multiplied by three to obtain the correct DNA locations."

Regular Expression Syntax
 The select tool searches the data for lines containing or not containing a match to the given pattern. A Regular Expression is a pattern descibing a certain amount of text. - 
( ) { } [ ] . * ? + \ ^ $
 are all special characters. 
\
 can be used to ""escape"" a special character, allowing that special character to be searched for. - 
^
 matches the beginning of a string(but not an internal line). - 
\d
 matches a digit, same as [0-9]. - 
\D
 matches a non-digit. - 
\s
 matches a whitespace character. - 
\S
 matches anything BUT a whitespace. - 
\t
 matches a tab. - 
\w
 matches an alphanumeric character ( A to Z, 0 to 9 and underscore ) - 
\W
 matches anything but an alphanumeric character. - 
(
 .. 
)
 groups a particular pattern. - 
\Z
 matches the end of a string(but not a internal line). - 
{
 n or n, or n,m 
}
 specifies an expected number of repetitions of the preceding pattern. - 
{n}
 The preceding item is matched exactly n times. - 
{n,}
 The preceding item ismatched n or more times. - 
{n,m}
 The preceding item is matched at least n times but not more than m times. - 
[
 ... 
]
 creates a character class. Within the brackets, single characters can be placed. A dash (-) may be used to indicate a range such as 
a-z
. - 
.
 Matches any single character except a newline. - 
*
 The preceding item will be matched zero or more times. - 
?
 The preceding item is optional and matched at most once. - 
+
 The preceding item will be matched one or more times. - 
^
 has two meaning: - matches the beginning of a line or string. - indicates negation in a character class. For example, [^...] matches every character except the ones inside brackets. - 
$
 matches the end of a line or string. - 
\|** Separates alternate possibilities."

 This tool sorts an input file. ----- 
Sorting Styles
 * 
Fast Numeric
: sort by numeric values. Handles integer values (e.g. 43, 134) and decimal-point values (e.g. 3.14). 
Does not
 handle scientific notation (e.g. -2.32e2). * 
General Numeric
: sort by numeric values. Handles all numeric notations (including scientific notation). Slower than 
fast numeric
, so use only when necessary. * 
Natural Sort
: Sort in 'natural' order (natural to humans, not to computers). See example below. * 
Alphabetical sort
: Sort in strict alphabetical order. See example below. * 
Human-readable numbers
: Sort human readble numbers (e.g. 1G > 2M > 3K > 400) * 
Random order
: return lines in random order. ------ 
Example - Header line
 
Input file
 (note first line is a header line, should not be sorted):: Fruit Color Price Banana Yellow 4.1 Avocado Green 8.0 Apple Red 3.0 Melon Green 6.1 
Sorting
 by 
numeric order
 on column 
3
, with 
header
, will return:: Fruit Color Price Apple Red 3.0 Banana Yellow 4.1 Melon Green 6.1 Avocado Green 8.0 ----- 
Example - Natural vs. Alphabetical sorting
 Given the following list:: chr4 chr13 chr1 chr10 chr20 chr2 
Alphabetical sort
 would produce the following sorted list:: chr1 chr10 chr13 chr2 chr20 chr4 
Natural Sort
 would produce the following sorted list:: chr1 chr2 chr4 chr10 chr13 chr20 .. class:: infomark If you're planning to use the file with another tool that expected sorted files (such as 
join
), you should use the 
Alphabetical sort
, not the 
Natural Sort
. Natural sort order is easier for humans, but is unnatural for computer programs. ----- 
Example - Sorting based on parts of column values
 The above column of chromosomes, with their constant prefix, could have been sorted in natural order also with the 
Fast numeric sort
 and 
considering its characters from
 character 4 only. In general, sorting based on just a range of characters in a column can be useful for sorting values with internal structure, in a single tool run. Consider, for example, the following column of dates, which is unfortunately not ISO-8601 formatted:: 10/24/2025 09/18/1974 12/16/1998 03/04/2007 You could modify these values with other tools first, but you can achieve correct chronological sort order with a single run of the sort tool like this: - Do a 
Fast numeric sort
 on the column 
considering its characters from
 character 7 (the start of the year). - Resolve ties (using another column selection section) with another 
Fast numeric sort
 on the same column 
considering its characters from
 character 1 
to and including
 character 2 (the month representation). - Resolve remaining ties with a third 
Fast numeric sort
 on again the same column 
considering its characters from
 character 4 
to and including
 character 5 (the day representation). This will result in the ascending chronological order:: 09/18/1974 11/17/1998 11/18/1998 12/16/1998 03/04/2007 10/24/2025 Before relying on in-column character ranges, make extra sure that all values are formatted consistently (in the above example, that all dates use two digits for days and months and the same overall date format)."

Pandas Data Analysis Library <https://pandas.pydata.org/>
 in Python, for manipulating and computing expressions upon tabular data and matrices. It can perform functions on the element, row, and column basis, as well as sub-select, duplicate, replace, and perform general and custom expressions on rows, columns, and elements. .. class:: infomark Only a single operation can be performed on the data. Multiple operations can be performed by chaining successive runs of this tool. This is to provide a more transparent workflow for complex operations. Many of the examples given below relate to common research use-cases such as filtering large matrices for specific values, counting unique instances of elements, conditionally manipulating the data, and replacing unwanted values. Full table operations such as normalisation can be easily performed by scaling the data via mean/median/min/max (and many other) metrics, and general expressions can even be computed across multiple tables. Examples ======== Example 1: Sub-selecting from a table ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ We have the following table: === === === === . c1 c2 c3 === === === === g1 10 20 30 g2 3 6 9 g3 4 8 12 g4 81 6 3 === === === === and we want to duplicate c1 and remove c2. Also select g1 to g3 and add g2 at the end as well. This would result in the output table: === === === === . c1 c1 c3 === === === === g1 10 10 30 g2 3 3 9 g3 4 4 12 g2 3 3 9 === === === === In Galaxy we would select the following: *

 Example 6: Perform operations on multiple tables ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ We have the following three input tables: Table 1 === === === === . c1 c2 c3 === === === === g1 10 20 30 g2 3 10 9 g3 4 8 10 === === === === Table 2 === === === . c1 c2 === === === g1 1 2 g2 3 4 g3 6 5 === === === Table 3 === === === === . c1 c2 c3 === === === === g1 1 2 3 g2 1 2 3 === === === === 
Note that the dimensions of these tables do not match.
 Dimensions: * Table1 [3,3] * Table2 [3,2] * Table3 [2,3] In order to perform simple operations between Tables, they must be of the same dimensions. To add Table2 to Table3 we would have to transpose one of the tables using the in-built 
T
 method:: table2 + table3.T or:: table2.T + table3 We can also perform more general operations using all 3 tables, such as taking the minimum value of the maximum values of Table2 and Table3, and dividing the Table1 values by it:: table1 / min(table2.values.max(), table3.values.max()) To perform these types of operations in Galaxy we would select the following: *

Custom Expression

 Please note that the last example shown above was chosen to illustrate the limitations of the tool. Nested attributes like 
table2.values.max
 are disallowed in expressions in the tool so the above would have to be replaced with the harder to read workaround:: table1 / min(np.max(np.max(table2)), np.max(np.max(table3))) .. class:: infomark Complex operations (like ones that would benefit from specifying nested attributes) can often be broken into subsequent runs ot the tool, in which the first run generates an intermediate table representing the result of the ""inner"" operation that the second run can then use as input to perform the ""outer"" operation. Also note that, currently 
min()
, 
max()
 and 
sum()
 are the only built-in Python functions that can be used inside expressions. If you want to use additional functions, these have to be qualified functions from the 
math
, 
np
 or 
pd
 libraries. Example 7: Melt ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ We have the following table === === === === . A B C === === === === 0 a B 1 1 b B 3 2 c B 5 === === === === and we want: === === ======== ===== .

AWK programs
 Most AWK programs consist of 
patterns
 (i.e. rules that match lines of text) and 
actions
 (i.e. commands to execute when a pattern matches a line). The basic form of AWK program is:: pattern { action 1; action 2; action 3; } 
Variables
 In order to allow parametrization in workflows, the tool allows to specify values for variables that can be used in AWK program. that will be named 
VAR1
, 
VAR2
, ... 
Pattern Examples
 - 
$2 == ""chr3""
 will match lines whose second column is the string 'chr3' - 
$5-$4>23
 will match lines that after subtracting the value of the fourth column from the value of the fifth column, gives value alrger than 23. - 
/AG..AG/
 will match lines that contain the regular expression 
AG..AG
 (meaning the characeters AG followed by any two characeters followed by AG). (This is the way to specify regular expressions on the entire line, similar to GREP.) - 
$7 ~ /A{4}U/
 will match lines whose seventh column contains 4 consecutive A's followed by a U. (This is the way to specify regular expressions on a specific field.) - 
10000 < $4 && $4 < 20000
 will match lines whose fourth column value is larger than 10,000 but smaller than 20,000 - 
BEGIN
 will be executed once only, before the first input record is read. - If no pattern is specified, all lines match (meaning the 
action
 part will be executed on all lines). 
Action Examples
 - 
{ print }
 or 
{ print $0 }
 will print the entire input line (the line that matched in 
pattern
). 
$0
 is a special marker meaning 'the entire line'. - 
{ print $1, $4, $5 }
 will print only the first, fourth and fifth fields of the input line. - 
{ print $4, $5-$4 }
 will print the fourth column and the difference between the fifth and fourth column. (If the fourth column was start-position in the input file, and the fifth column was end-position - the output file will contain the start-position, and the length). - 
{ FS = "","" }
 can be used to change the field separator (delimeter) for parsing the input file. - If no action part is specified (not even the curly brackets) - the default action is to print the entire line. 
AWK's Regular Expression Syntax
 The select tool searches the data for lines containing or not containing a match to the given pattern. A Regular Expression is a pattern descibing a certain amount of text. - 
( ) { } [ ] . * ? + \ ^ $
 are all special characters. 
\
 can be used to ""escape"" a special character, allowing that special character to be searched for. - 
^
 matches the beginning of a string(but not an internal line). - 
(
 .. 
)
 groups a particular pattern. - 
{
 n or n, or n,m 
}
 specifies an expected number of repetitions of the preceding pattern. - 
{n}
 The preceding item is matched exactly n times. - 
{n,}
 The preceding item ismatched n or more times. - 
{n,m}
 The preceding item is matched at least n times but not more than m times. - 
[
 ... 
]
 creates a character class. Within the brackets, single characters can be placed. A dash (-) may be used to indicate a range such as 
a-z
. - 
.
 Matches any single character except a newline. - 
*
 The preceding item will be matched zero or more times. - 
?
 The preceding item is optional and matched at most once. - 
+
 The preceding item will be matched one or more times. - 
^
 has two meaning: - matches the beginning of a line or string. - indicates negation in a character class. For example, [^...] matches every character except the ones inside brackets. - 
$
 matches the end of a line or string. - 
\|** Separates alternate possibilities."

Sed commands
 The most useful sed command is 
s
 (substitute). 
Examples
 - 
s/hsa//
 will remove the first instance of 'hsa' in every line. - 
s/hsa//g
 will remove all instances (beacuse of the 
g
) of 'hsa' in every line. - 
s/A{4,}/--&--/g
 will find sequences of 4 or more consecutive A's, and once found, will surround them with two dashes from each side. The 
&
 marker is a place holder for 'whatever matched the regular expression'. - 
s/hsa-mir-([^ ]+)/short name: \1 full name: &/
 will find strings such as 'hsa-mir-43a' (the regular expression is 'hsa-mir-' followed by non-space characters) and will replace it will string such as 'short name: 43a full name: hsa-mir-43a'. The 
\1
 marker is a place holder for 'whatever matched the first parenthesis' (similar to perl's 
$1
) .

Purpose
 The 
diff
 utility is a data comparison tool that calculates and displays the differences between two files. Unlike edit distance notions used for other purposes, diff is line-oriented rather than character-oriented, but it is like Levenshtein distance in that it tries to determine the smallest set of deletions and insertions to create one file from the other. The diff command displays the changes made in a standard format, such that both humans and machines can understand the changes and apply them: given one file and the changes, the other file can be created. .. class:: infomark 
Input
 Two text files to be checked for differences line by line. .. class:: infomark 
Output
 A 
text file
, either: - containing the lines differences in 
unified format
 (
unidiff
), - or an 
empty
 file if the two input files are the same. An 
optional
 
HTML report
 with a friendlier visual representation of the differences."
